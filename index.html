    <h2>GitHub Wiki</h2>
    <p>Every repository on GitHub comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use
        your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed
        it, or its core principles. A README file quickly tells what your project can do, while you can use a wiki to
        provide additional documentation. For more information, see "About READMEs."</p>
    <h2>About wikis</h2>
    <p>With wikis, you can write content just like everywhere else on GitHub. For more information, see "Getting started
        with writing and formatting on GitHub." We use our open-source Markup library to convert different formats into
        HTML, so you can choose to write in Markdown or any other supported format.</p>
